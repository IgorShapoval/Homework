            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
            capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components:
            <span class="text-italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>.
            You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s
            cover how components work in React Native.

            React Native runs on <span class="text-underline">React</span>, a
            popular open source library for building user interfaces with
            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
            React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a
            refresher course.

            We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="react__item">
              <p>
                <span class="text-bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this
                introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="react__item">
              <p>
                <span class="text-bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use
                JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                like so:
                <span class="text-bg"
                  >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The React docs have
                <span class="text-underline">a comprehensive guide to JS</span>
                you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you
                can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                <span class="text-bg">name</span> for the cat, name, and
                embedding it with curly braces inside
                <span class="text-bg">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="react__item">
              <p>
                <span class="text-bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for
                “properties”.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="react__item">
              <p>
                <span class="text-bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of
                props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is
                useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
                from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

          <p>
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an <span class="text-italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes
            a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
            onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the
            text is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence
            "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
